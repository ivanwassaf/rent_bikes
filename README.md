# rent_bikes
A company rents bikes

# Context
A company rents bikes under following options:
1. Rental by hour, charging $5 per hour
2. Rental by day, charging $20 a day
3. Rental by week, changing $60 a week
4. Family Rental, is a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount
of 30% of the total price
5. The values could change in the future if the client decides at any time
6: Implement a persistence model for the rents information
7. Implement a kind of message queue model to send and receive the information of the rents that the user creates
8. At the moment of the project, no providers for data persistance nor message exchange have been defined

# Assigment:
1. Implement a set of classes to model this domain and logic
2. Add automated tests to ensure a coverage over 85%
3. Use GitHub to store and version your code
4. Apply all the recommended practices you would use in a real project
5. Add a README.md file to the root of your repository to explain: your design, the development
practices you applied and how run the tests.
Note: we don't expect any kind of application, just a set of classes with its automated tests.
